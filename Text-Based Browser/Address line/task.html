<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Every browser accepts a string from the user and then displays a web page. The string from the user is a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and looks something like this: <a href="https://www.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.google.com</a>. After receiving the URL, the browser has a lot of work to do, but in a nutshell, this work results in finding the web page. It is located somewhere on the Internet, and the browser retrieves it. Since the <code class="java">https://www.</code> part is always the same, it is often omitted and the link is shortened to <code class="java">google.com</code>.</p>
<p>In the first stage, we'll try to imitate this behavior. In the source code, you will find two predefined variables that contain news texts. You will need to print their content as a response to the corresponding input URL.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In the first stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept a URL from the user as input.
	<ol>
<li>If the user input <code class="java">bloomberg.com</code>, print the content of the <code class="java">bloomberg_com</code> variable.</li>
<li>If the user input <code class="java">nytimes.com</code>, print the content of the <code class="java">nytimes_com</code> variable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Keep on prompting the user for input until they type <code class="java">exit</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

The Space Race: From Apollo 11 to Elon Musk

It's 50 years since the world was gripped by historic images
of Apollo 11, and Neil Armstrong -- the first man to walk
on the moon. It was the height of the Cold War, and the charts
were filled with David Bowie's Space Oddity, and Creedence's
Bad Moon Rising. The world is a very different place than
it was 5 decades ago. But how has the space race changed since
the summer of '69? (Source: Bloomberg)
